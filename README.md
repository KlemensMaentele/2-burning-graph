1. Which heuristics or approximation strategies produce near optimal burning sequences and approximate 2-
burning numbers within reasonable time?
2. What is the 2-burning number and the minimum number of sources for the chosen class of graphs?
3. How close are the results of heuristic algorithms to the exact solutions in terms of the 2-burning number and
sequence length?
4. Are there faster exact algorithms than brute forcing every possible sequence?
5. For what graph classes does a faster exact algorithm exist?
6. How do these exact algorithms scale with the size of the graphs?
